    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hello, I'm Sejal, a passionate and driven third-year Computer Engineering student at Sinhgad Academy of Engineering. My journey into the world of technology started with an interest in how websites are built, and over time, it evolved into a deep love for web development.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have hands-on experience with various web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks such as React. Along with web development, I’m also exploring Python for machine learning and automation, and have a keen interest in robotics and workshops that enhance my technical skills.
